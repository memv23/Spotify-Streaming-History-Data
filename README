To use, go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
and register your app.

Replace "REDACTED" info with your own private client & secret IDs, as well as your own user ID. 

Install Spotipy: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.11.1/
Running 'Spotify Streaming History Data 1.py' will produce a JSON file, and
Running 'Spotify Streaming History Data 2.py' will open the JSON file created from the previous program, and produce another JSON file.
Running Spotify Streaming History Data 3.py' will open the last JSON file created and export a CSV file.

The reason it's broken up into three separate programs is due to the rate-limited nature of Spotify's API.
If your streaming history is too large, the program will time out before finishing because there is no refresh token included in this program.

There is no refresh token included because my streaming history was not too big to use and also I couldn't figure the refresh token out.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

You can import the CSV file into Microsoft Power BI or similar and visualize the data you've collected.
